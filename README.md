# Cyclistic Capstone Project

This project was developed as the final capstone for the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** offered by Coursera. It follows the six-step data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act — applied to a real-world bike-sharing dataset.

## 📊 Project Objective

The main business task is to analyze usage patterns between two user types — **casual riders** and **annual members** — with the goal of identifying actionable insights that can help **convert more casual riders into annual members**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **R** (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate)
- **RStudio**
- **Git & GitHub**

### 🙏 Acknowledgments

Parts of this project were inspired by publicly available work from other data analysts ( https://github.com/ojaswani16 ). I used those sources as a reference to guide the structure and storytelling of my own analysis. All visualizations, code, and conclusions presented here were developed independently as part of my own learning process.

Special thanks to the data analytics community for sharing open-source projects that help others learn and grow.
